  <h2>Teaching</h2>
  <p>
    Teaching has always been central to my professional and personal identity. I believe that knowledge only has value when it is shared, and I see teaching as a way to give back to the community. My teaching approach is guided by four central principles: active learning, real-world application, inclusivity, and assessment-informed instruction.

    I have had multiple opportunities to apply my teaching goals during my teaching and mentoring experiences so far. I have served as the instructor of record and as a teaching assistant on several occasions. Beyond classroom teaching, I have mentored students through the Latin American and Caribbean Studies Center program at UMD, guiding a senior student through her final capstone project on Latin American politics—from refining the research topic to conducting a literature review and collecting data. Below, I detail each of these experiences:
