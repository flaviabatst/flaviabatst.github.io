<p>
Teaching is central to my professional and personal identity. I believe that knowledge only has value when it is shared, and I see teaching as a way to give back to the community. Education has transformed my own life, enabling me to pursue this application for an assistant professor position, and I firmly believe it is the one asset no one can take from you.
</p>

<p>
I have had multiple opportunities to apply my teaching goals during my teaching and mentoring experiences so far. I have served as the instructor of record and as a teaching assistant on several occasions. Beyond classroom teaching, I have mentored students through the <a href="https://lacs.umd.edu/" target="_blank">Latin American and Caribbean Studies Center</a> program at UMD, guiding a senior student through her final capstone project on Latin American politics, from refining the research topic to conducting a literature review and collecting data.
</p>

<p>
My teaching approach is guided by four central principles: active learning, real-world application, inclusivity, and assessment-informed instruction. I have applied these principles primarily as the instructor of International Political Relations while also drawing on experiences as a teaching assistant at the University of Maryland.

## Student Evaluations
<p>
In all my classes as instructor of record, I received over 90% (on an agree-disagree scale) ratings across all evaluated categories, including feedback, grading criteria, communication about the course, real-world application, inclusivity, building on prior knowledge, confidence in students’ potential, and instructor care for student learning. Students also reported nearly 80% likelihood of recommending me as an instructor for this course.
</p>

<p>When asked, “What about the course and/or instruction most enhanced your learning?” students offered comments such as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Professor Batista's guided lecture videos were very helpful, along with her posting the course slides.”</p>

<p>“I loved this class! Despite attendance not being required, almost every student showed up because her class was so engaging. I really enjoyed her positive comments on assignments. The class was well thought out, and I would love to have her teaching another one of my classes in the future.”</p>

<p>“I enjoyed the case studies we did. Each case study made the class more interesting and allowed us to apply our learning to real-world situations. Additionally, the mid-term and final paper helped reinforce the content.”</p>

<p>“I liked that she connected what we learned in class to real-world situations. The content was clearly applicable to current events, and I appreciated that she allowed us to explore these connections.”</p>

<p>“I believe Professor Flavia's enthusiasm and dedication during lectures really helped enhance my learning.”</p>

<p>“The one thing that enhanced my learning was how accommodating Flavia was. Despite not having online classes, she was very communicative via email when I had questions and in setting up office hours. She set people on track by organizing the course in a structured way, sending assignment reminders, and had a very encouraging attitude, even when I felt like I was asking silly questions.”</p>
